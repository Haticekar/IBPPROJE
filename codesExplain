Bootstrap and Responsive Design:
I used the Bootstrap framework to provide a responsive design that works well on desktop,
tablet and mobile.
I tried to structure your HTML using Bootstrap classes and components for responsive
layout and styling.


2. Admin Panel and Login Page:
Create an Admin Panel using the AdminLTE template, which is Bootstrap compatible and
provides a user-friendly interface to manage the system.
Implemented a login page where administrators can log in using their email and passwords.


3. User Roles and Authentication:
At least two user roles have been defined in the database, such as "Administrator" and
"Standard User".
Implement user registration and login functionality, where users can register with their
email (username) and password.
Tried to encrypt passwords using a secure hash algorithm like SHA.


4. Admin Pages:
Name, email, role, etc. Attempted to create pages for administrators to manage (add,
update, delete) users, including user information.
Implement a separate page for the administrator to save, update and delete announcements
to be displayed on the home page of standard users.
Provided functionality for administrators to read and reply to messages sent by standard
users. View the sender, timestamp and message content.


5. Standard User Pages:
Implement a login page for standard users to access their account using their email and
password.
Allow standard users to update their own passwords.
Pages are provided for standard users to view data (eg player records) entered by the
administrator and search using grids or lists with search functionality.
Standard users have been enabled to see the announcements from the administrator on the
home page.
An attempt was made to add a page where standard users can send messages to the
administrator and the administrator can read and reply to these messages.
